1. Create a new component based on paragraphs module. 

2. The component will consist of 2-4 (up to 2 in one row) subcomponents containing the following fields: 

   - Image - required (2 images for desktop/mobile). 

   - Label Text - optional. 

   - Heading Text - required. 

   - Description Text - required. 

   - (CTA Button) Link to a resource with editable text - optional. 

3. Write JavaScript code that will equalize the height of the blocks so that they are always the same height, even if the content in one of the blocks differs slightly (if we have 4 subcomponents arranged in 2 rows,  

   then align the top row by height and the bottom row separately). 

4. Write JavaScript code when clicking the mouse on the image, display a tooltip leading to the CTA Button with the message of the component's heading (See in figma file).  

   Clicking anywhere else on the page should make this message disappear. 

5. The component should be responsive, ensuring that the blocks display correctly on different devices (mobile, tablets, desktops).
